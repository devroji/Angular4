<u>Security under God's Protection:</u>
You dewell in the shelter of the most high, 
who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, 
Say to the Lord my refuge fortress.
My God in whom I trust, God will rescue you from the 
fowler's snare, from the destroying plague will shelter 
you with pinions, spread wings that you may take refuge.
God's faithfulness is a protecting shield, 
you shall not fear the terror of the night, 
nor the arrow that flies by day, 
nor the pestilence that roams in darkness,
nor the plague that ravages at noon.
Though a thousand fall at your side,
ten thousand at your right hand,
near you it shall not come. You need simply watch,
the punishment of the wicked you will see.
You have the Lord for your refuge,
you have made the most high your strong hold,
no evil shall be fall you, no afflection come near your tent,
for God commands the angels to guard you in all your ways.
With thier hands they shall support you.
